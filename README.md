## What is this?

This is a Home Assistant integration for the Norwegian waste collection company HRA (Hadeland Ringerike Avfallsselskap). You can track the pickup dates for the different fractions (Plastic, bio, glass/metal and unsorted waste)

> Norwegian text will appear here.

## Installation

This integration is currently in development. It will not work if you try it right now. It will not work until I release 0.1.0.

Version plans
- [ ] 0.1.0 First release. Will have basic functionality. All the fractions will be shown. User mistakes will not be accounted for. This will break the integration and throw errors around :)

- [ ] 0.2.0 Catch user mistakes and correct them. Alternatively use default settings.

- [ ] 0.3.0

- [ ] 0.4.0

- [ ] 0.5.0 Code refactoring

- [ ] 0.8.0 The logo and icon has to be online.

- [ ] 0.9.0 External testing. Noen som vil teste? :)

- [ ] 1.0.0 Final release. You can choose wich fractions to track. The integration has been thorougly tested.
