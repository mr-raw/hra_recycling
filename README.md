## What is this?

This is a Home Assistant integration for the Norwegian waste collection company HRA (Hadeland Ringerike Avfallsselskap). You can track the pickup dates for the different fractions (Plastic, bio, glass/metal and unsorted waste)

> Norwegian text will appear here.

## Installation

This integration is currently in development. It will not work if you try it right now. It will not work until I release 0.1.0.

Version plans
- [ ] 0.1.0 First release. Will have basic functionality. All the fractions will be shown. User mistakes will not be accounted for. This will break the integration and throw errors around :)

- More info to come.

- [ ] 1.0.0 Final release. You can choose which fractions to track. The integration has been thorougly tested.


## Setup and configuration is done in the UI
